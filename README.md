# LEDS on the ESP32

Currently just have 2 buttons plugged into the board.
One on 12, and one on 14.

Button 1 On 12 - short press turns on, then cycles between a blue/yellow pattern to a green/purple "hulk" pattern.

Button 2 on 14 - short press picks 2 random colours and splits them at a random interval.
